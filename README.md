# Graphs-and-their-Uses
Coding exploration of Oystein Ore's Graph Theory textbook. I am working through the book and implementing theorems.

![Graphs and Their Uses](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41fVSQ1M8vL.jpg)

## Chapter 1: What are Graphs?

### Concepts Covered:
- **Definitions**: Vertices, edges
- **Types of Graphs**: Directed, undirected, simple, null, compliment and weighted graphs.

## Ruby Practice Plan
- Representing a Graph
- - Implement a Graph as an adjacency list
  - Methods:
  - - Add vertcies
    - Add edges
    - Display the graph
  - Method to count number of edges and vertices


## Chapter 2: Paths and Connectivity

### Concepts Covered:
- Paths and cycles in graphs.
- Connected Components

## Ruby Practice Plan
- Find all the neighbors
- Recursive Depth First Search method to explore all reachable vertices from a starting point.
- Use DFS to check if the graph is connected.
